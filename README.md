# Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

# Project Motivation

This is a Udacity Nanodegree Program. Having seeing business owners(mall owners) go through the struggle of categorizing their customers, and struggle decisions concerning promotions or customers to focus on while strategizing on the improvement of the business motivated this project.

There is also a notebook available here to showcsae all my work related to all questions.

# Result

The result is also in the notebook.

# Acknowledgement

Must give credit to Udacity courses for some of code ideas, and to kaggle/VijayChoudhary for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle. Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
